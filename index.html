    <h1>Storm Drain DNA: This Rubbish Could Be Yours</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>Where It Comes From</h2>
    <p>We collected rubbish from drains around Eastern Beach to show how litter from our streets ends up in the sea. Just after rainfall, we found plastic straws twisted by water flow, food wrappers crumpled by boots, bottle caps smoothed by grit, and even vape pods bearing logos from local shops—all within metres of stormwater drains. These drains flow straight to the ocean—unfiltered, untreated, and unmonitored—carrying every bit of debris into the Hauraki Gulf.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
    <p>When rubbish washes into storm drains, it never gets filtered. It streams through pipes and emerges on beaches, in estuaries, and into the heart of the Hauraki Gulf. Recent studies reveal that 1 in 3 fish here contain plastic fragments in their guts, and microplastics have been detected in every shellfish sample taken from these waters. Polluted sediment alters habitats for juvenile fish, toxins accumulate in the food web, and our local kaimoana and seafood become vectors for human exposure to harmful chemicals.</p>

    <h2>Our Process</h2>
    <p>Over two rainy weekends, our team mapped ten drains along the Eastern Beach shoreline and adjacent carparks. We surveyed each site, documented the litter we found, and recorded GPS coordinates for our map. Back at our pop-up lab, we rinsed and dried each item, weighed it, photographed it in a lightbox, and assigned it a “culprit score” based on proximity and material type. We then attached each piece to a jar with a custom label—complete with the discovery date, location, and a QR code linking to its photo and data entry.</p>

    <h2>What We’re Trying To Do</h2>
    <p>This project is about more than displaying trash—it’s about shifting mindsets. By seeing your own reflection hovering over a jar of evidence, we want you to recognize that the responsibility for clean water is shared. We ask you: if this was your chip packet, would you still toss it carelessly? If these jars make you pause before you litter, then we’ve succeeded.</p>

    <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Don’t drop rubbish near drains.</li>
      <li>Carry a small bag for wrappers or empties.</li>
      <li>If you see litter, pick it up—even if it’s not yours.</li>
      <li>Join our monthly clean-up at Eastern Beach—details on the calendar page.</li>
      <li>Talk to local cafés about swapping plastic cutlery for compostable alternatives.</li>
      <li>Share our website and QR code on social media to spread the message.</li>
    </ul>
